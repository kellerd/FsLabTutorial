# FsLab Tutorial
- Demo I wanted to give
- FsLab, collection of awesome Data Libraries
- Keep saying F# makes me look better at work, little sample of why

# That one app
- So I'm sure everyone has that one app.
- It's not pretty, it's not complete. You might've even re-done the app several times.
- Most apps, especially line of business, what i normally deal in are simple
  - There no real complicated domain
  - There is no business logic
  - It's just some huge side effecting page. Page after page of direct database access or update. 
- What it does have, is data. That's the money.
   - If only you could work with it a little better, massage it, there might be some hidden answer

- Any Math majors, accountants or statisticians in the crowd?
  - Ok, so you guys already know how to look at some data and get a good idea on how things are going
- Me, I'll have to poke around a bit. Statistics was 10-12 years ago
- There are some awesome things built in or with F#
  - Project Springfield, Whitebox Fuzzing for security testing
- Walmart bought Jet.com for it's F# pricing engine for 3 Billion

# Greytide
- My website, isn't the greatest thing written in F#
- Use it for testing different frameworks.
- D3.js (Draws things, hopefully you can pull enough together to make some sense)
- Angular, C# Web Api, Copying some code from a SPA course
- Browser storage
- Then NoSQL, Cloud providers
- Suave (Web framework for F#). F# Mentorship
- Doing the practical thing, trying to get an opinion on things I'm not allowed to do at work
- Some good decisions, store history of events

# VsCode/Ionide
- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Cross platform, lightweight, free
- [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) plugin for FSharp awesomeness
- Paket, F# package manager. Nuget only goes so far, paket does nuget, 
- [FsLab](http://fslab.org)



# RProvider
- Dan this is great, but it's a little rudimentary. We need some pro tools here.
- Who knows R? I don't either
- Best thing about R was it was made by statisticians. The worst thing about R was that it was made by statisticians


# Summary
- Use, learn some statistics I learned in the past
- Without having to remember javascript, css, some random drawing framework, that you need some other framework to use easily.
- (Stats about c# impl and f# impl, -140k lines of packages, ect)
- Learned what I like painting, where are my bottlenecks. 
  - Change the way I paint.  Assembly line the easy stuff to a certain point, spend time on the details.
