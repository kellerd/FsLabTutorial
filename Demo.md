# FsLab Tutorial
- Demo I wanted to give
- FsLab, collection of awesome Data Libraries
- Keep saying F# makes me look better at work, little sample of why

# That one app
- So I'm sure everyone has that one app.
- It's not pretty, it's not complete. You might've even re-done the app several times.
- Most apps, especially line of business, what i normally deal in are simple
  - There no real complicated domain
  - There is no business logic
  - It's just some huge side effecting page. Page after page of direct database access or update. 
- What it does have, is data. That's the money.
   - If only you could work with it a little better, massage it, there might be some hidden answer

- Any Math majors, accountants or statisticians in the crowd?
  - Ok, so you guys already know how to look at some data and get a good idea on how things are going
- Me, I'll have to poke around a bit. Statistics was 10-12 years ago
- There are some awesome things built in or with F#
  - Project Springfield, Whitebox Fuzzing for security testing
- Walmart bought Jet.com for it's F# pricing engine for 3 Billion

# Greytide
- My website, isn't the greatest thing written in F#
- Use it for testing different frameworks.
- D3.js (Draws things, hopefully you can pull enough together to make some sense)
- Angular, C# Web Api, Copying some code from a SPA course
- Browser storage
- Then NoSQL, Cloud providers
- Doing the practical thing, trying to get an opinion on things I'm not allowed to do at work
- Some good decisions, store history of events
- How to make it better
 - Suave (Web framework for F#). F# Mentorship
 - (Stats about c# impl and f# impl, -140k lines of packages, ect)

# VsCode/Ionide
- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Cross platform, lightweight, free
- [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) plugin for FSharp awesomeness
- Paket, F# package manager. Nuget only goes so far, paket does nuget, 
- [FsLab](http://fslab.org)

# Demo
- World bank providers
  - Pick two countries
  - \`` Double backtick quotation ``
  - Math like abs, - 
- Series, index by years, sort, take, ect
- Chart Line, Labels
- Chart Geo

- Html Provider
 - Dual with wiki page. (Web scraping)
- Various ways to query? maybe
- Csv Provider
 - Changing column name
- JsonProvider light
 - Provide single sample
  - make Array
  - Change field to optional

- GreyTide service
 - Change version
 - Show what some properties mean
- Infinite Seq
- Bar chart, but shorter
- Moving mean
- Fill with missing
- Get certain columns
- Trendlines (primed, completed, assembled high. Painted not so much)
- Try online v2, Whoops. v3 without auth


# RProvider
- Dan this is great, but it's a little rudimentary. We need some pro tools here.
- Who knows R? I don't either
- Best thing about R was it was made by statisticians. The worst thing about R was that it was made by statisticians
- Install
- R Histogram, pie
- Basic statistics
- Kmeans
 - Centers (Heroes, Big dudes, Infantry)
 - Get some data out of R, some models 
# Summary
- Use, learn some statistics I learned in the past
- Without having to remember javascript, css, some random drawing framework, that you need some other framework to use easily.
- Learned what I like painting, where are my bottlenecks. 
  - Change the way I paint.  Assembly line the easy stuff to a certain point, spend time on the details.
